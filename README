1 Colorize ls output
=====================
  =ls-color= is a simple application written in C to colorize =ls= output similar to [trapd00r/ls--] (see Motivation).

1.1 Installation
-----------------
   You can install using GNU =autotools=:



  autoreconf -i
  ./configure
  make
  make install


1.2 Customization
------------------
   Some colors and UI symbols can be customized editing the =src/config.h= file. =ls-color= needs to be recompiled for any changes to take effect.

1.3 Basic usage
----------------
   =ls-color= accepts the same arguments as =ls= but you can't display different fields.

   (Also, some arguments are used internally to ensure some required fields are present)

1.4 Motivation
---------------
   Some time ago I saw [trapd00r/ls--] project. It looked really cool and I wanted to try it. Unfortunatly I didn't want to install PERL dependencies just for that so I ended giving up. Later, I decided to just do my own implementation in C so I created =ls-color=. I never used =ls--= so I'm not sure how is different from =ls-color=. But =ls--= is a more mature project and probably has more features so maybe you should try it instead of =ls-color=.

1.5 Todo
----------
   - Add support to customize output fields (owner, group, datetimes, etc)
