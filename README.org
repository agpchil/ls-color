* Colorize ls output
  =ls-color= is a simple application written in C to colorize =ls= output similar to [[https://github.com/trapd00r/ls--][trapd00r/ls--]] (see Motivation).

** Installation
   You can install using GNU =autotools=:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   autoreconf -i
   ./configure
   make
   make install
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Customization
   Some colors and UI symbols can be customized editing the =src/config.h= file. =ls-color= needs to be recompiled for any changes to take effect.

** Basic usage
   =ls-color= accepts the same arguments as =ls= but you can't display different fields.
   
   (Also, some arguments are used internally to ensure some required fields are present)

** Motivation
   Some time ago I saw [[https://github.com/trapd00r/ls--][trapd00r/ls--]] project. It looked really cool and I wanted to try it. Unfortunatly I didn't want to install PERL dependencies just for that so I ended giving up. Later, I decided to just do my own implementation in C so I created =ls-color=. I never used =ls--= so I'm not sure how is different from =ls-color=. But =ls--= is a more mature project and probably has more features so maybe you should try it instead of =ls-color=.

** Todo
   - Add support to customize output fields (owner, group, datetimes, etc)
